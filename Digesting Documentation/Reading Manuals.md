# Digesting Documentation

## Reading Manuals
This level introduces the man command. man is short for manual, and will display (if available) the manual of the command you pass as an argument. For example, let's say we wanted to learn about the yes command (yes, this is a real command):

`hacker@dojo:~$ man yes`

This will display the manual page for yes, which will look something like this:
```
YES(1)                           User Commands                          YES(1)

NAME
       yes - output a string repeatedly until killed

SYNOPSIS
       yes [STRING]...
       yes OPTION

DESCRIPTION
       Repeatedly output a line with all specified STRING(s), or 'y'.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

The important sections are:
```
NAME(1)                           CATEGORY                          NAME(1)

NAME
	This gives the name (and short description) of the command or
	concept discussed by the page.

SYNOPSIS
	This gives a short usage synopsis. These synopses have a standard
	format. Typically, each line is a different valid invocation of the
	command, and the lines can be read as:

	COMMAND [OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT] SINGLE_MANDATORY_ARGUMENT
	COMMAND [OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT] MULTIPLE_ARGUMENTS...

DESCRIPTION
	Details of the command or concept, with detailed descriptions
	of the various options.

SEE ALSO
	Other man pages or online resources that might be useful.

COLLECTION                        DATE                          NAME(1)
```
You can scroll around the manpage with your arrow keys and PgUp/PgDn. When you're done reading the manpage, you can hit q to quit.

Manpages are stored in a centralized database. If you're curious, this database lives in the /usr/share/man directory, but you never need to interact with it directly: you just query it using the man command. The arguments to the man command aren't file paths, but just the names of the entries themselves (e.g., you run man yes to look up the yes manpage, rather than man /usr/bin/yes, which would be the actual path to the yes program but would result in man displaying garbage).

The challenge in this level has a secret option that, when you use it, will cause the challenge to print the flag. You must learn this option through the man page for challenge!




### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{kQUj8GbwA0j-9lEWMyHLk5YB1h4.QX0EDO0wSNyMzNzEzW}`

The manual of the program `challenge` can be displayed using the `man` command.
```
CHALLENGE(1)                                                  Challenge Commands                                                  CHALLENGE(1)

NAME
       /challenge/challenge - print the flag!

SYNOPSIS
       challenge OPTION

DESCRIPTION
       Output the flag when called with the right arguments.

       --fortune
              read a fortune

       --version
              output version information and exit

       --kjbwjl NUM
              print the flag if NUM is 809

 Manual page challenge(1) line 1/31 (END) (press h for help or q to quit)
```
As seen in the manual, when `--kjbwjl 809` is given as argument to the program `/challenge/challenge`, the required flag is printed.

```
man challenge
/challenge/challenge --kjbwjl 809
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{kQUj8GbwA0j-9lEWMyHLk5YB1h4.QX0EDO0wSNyMzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings

The `man` command takes another command or program as its argument and displays its manual. The manual contains the name of the command/program, the different ways to call it and the different arguments it can take.
