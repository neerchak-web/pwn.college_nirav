# File Globbing

## Tab completion
As tempting as it might be, using * to shorten what must be typed on the commandline can lead to mistakes. Your glob might expand to unintended files, and you might not spot it until the rm command is already running! No one is safe from this style of error.

A safer alternative when you are trying to specify a specific target is tab completion. If you hit tab in the shell, it'll try to figure out what you're going to type and automatically complete it. Auto-completion is super useful, and this challenge will explore its use in specifying files.

This challenge has copied the flag into /challenge/pwncollege, and you can freely cat that file. But you can't type the filename: we used some serious trickery to make sure that you must tab-complete it. Try it out!
```
hacker@dojo:~$ ls /challenge
DESCRIPTION.md  pwncollege
hacker@dojo:~$ cat /challenge/pwncollege
cat: /challenge/pwncollege: No such file or directory
hacker@dojo:~$ cat /challenge/pwn<TAB>
pwn.college{HECK YEAH}
hacker@dojo:~$
```
When you hit that tab key, the name will expand and you'll be able to read the file. Good luck!


### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{YbZjm6v28sHtf0skyLYYjUllB3R.0FN0EzNxwSNyMzNzEzW}`

To retrieve the flag, we need to read the contents of the file `/challenge/pwncollege`. However, the `cat` command will not work for this file if we type out the full filepath.

We can use tab completion instead to enter the filepath without typing it out completely. The safest option is to type out all but the last characters in the address and use tab completion for the very last character (`e`).

```
cat /challenge/pwncollegeâ€‹ 
pwn.college{YbZjm6v28sHtf0skyLYYjUllB3R.0FN0EzNxwSNyMzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings

The linux shell has an auto-complete feature using the `tab` key. While typing in a file/directory name, hitting `tab` will automatically complete the line if a name which contains the inputted pattern exists.
