# Perceiving Permissions

## Permission Tweaking Practice
You think you can chmod? Let's practice!

This challenge will ask you to change the permissions of the /challenge/pwn file in specific ways a few times in a row. If you get the permissions wrong, the game will reset and you can try again. If you get the permissions right eight times in a row, the challenge will let you chmod /flag to make it readable for yourself :-) Launch /challenge/run to get started!


### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0EbBpcCXe6854sXUCidgc0uJd5m.QXwEjN0wSNyMzNzEzW}`

To retrieve the flag, we need to run `/challenge/run`.

In this level we will be allowed to use `chmod` without root access. We need to grant permissions as specified by the terminal. We can chain permissions in one statement for user, group and world by separating them with `,`. For example:

`chmod u-rx,a-r /challenge/pwn`

After granting all the permissions correctly, we will be allowed to change access permissions for `/flag`.

You set the correct permissions!
You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
chmod u+r /flag
cat /flag

### New Learnings

This challenge requires us to combine all the different options of the command `chmod` based on the specifications given in the level.
