# Perceiving Permissions

## Permissions Setting Practice
In addition to adding and removing permissions, as in the previous level, chmod can also simply set permissions altogether, overwriting the old ones. This is done by using = instead of - or +. For example:

u=rw sets read and write permissions for the user, and wipes the execute permission
o=x sets only executable permissions for the world, wiping read and write
a=rwx sets read, write, and executable permissions for the user, group, and world!
But what if you want to change user permissions in a different way as group permissions? Say, you want to set rw for the owning user, but only r for the owning group? You can achieve this by chaining multiple modes to chmod with ,!

chmod u=rw,g=r /challenge/pwn will set the user permissions to read and write, and the group permissions to read-only
chmod a=r,u=rw /challenge/pwn will set the user permissions to read and write, and the group and world permissions to read-only
Additionally, you can zero out permissions with -:

chmod u=rw,g=r,o=- /challenge/pwn will set the user permissions to read and write, the group permissions to read-only, and the world permissions to nothing at all
Keep in mind, that -, appearing after = is in a different context than if it appeared directly after the u, g, or o (in which case, it would cause specific bits to be removed, not everything).

This level extends the previous level by requesting more radical permission changes, which you will need = and ,-chaining to achieve. Good luck!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0QQizzwbFmeGMkt-DFYeC9NjN0Q.QXzETO0wSNyMzNzEzW}`

To retrieve the flag, we need to run `/challenge/run`.

In this level we will be allowed to use `chmod` without root access. We need to grant permissions as specified by the terminal. We can chain permissions in one statement for user, group and world by separating them with `,`. For example:

`chmod u-rx,a-r /challenge/pwn`

After granting all the permissions correctly, we will be allowed to change access permissions for `/flag`.

You set the correct permissions!
You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
chmod u+r /flag
cat /flag

### New Learnings

`chmod` can also be used to overwrite permissions, using `=` instead of `+`/`-`.
